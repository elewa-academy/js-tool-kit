# JS Tool Kit

This repository contains a collection of tools to help you visualize, debug, and develop.  We've' split these tools into two groups:
* [__Learning Environments__](./learning-environments.md):
  * These tools are designed to highlight one particular skill or feature of programming.  You will find these tools indispensable at the beginning of your programming journey. But don't think these are just toys for beginners!  We regularly use these tools ourselves when we develop our own projects, try to master new skills, or keep our old skills up to date.
* [__Pro Tools__](./pro-tools.md):
  * These tools are designed to maximize developer productivity.  You can use them to practice the same skills and concepts as in the Learning Environments but they assume you already have a working understanding of programming, JS, and the development environment.  Each Learning Environment markdown will provide a link to it's Pro Tool equivalent.
